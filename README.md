# [[COMPANY_NAME]] Web App

This repository contains a Next.js (App Router) website for a U.S. engineering services firm specializing in radar systems, AI integration and aerospace/space engineering. The site is built with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide icons and adheres to high accessibility and performance standards.

## Features

- **Modern Tech Stack** — Next.js 13 app router with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS and shadcn‑like component patterns.
- **Dark Mode by Default** — Supports light/dark toggling via local storage and respects the user’s `prefers‑color‑scheme` setting.
- **Responsive Design** — Layout adapts gracefully from mobile to large screens using Tailwind’s utility classes.
- **Accessibility** — Semantic HTML, labelled form inputs, keyboard focus styles and motion reductions for users who prefer reduced motion.
- **Content‑Driven** — Services and case studies are defined in `/content` as TypeScript objects for easy editing without touching React components.
- **SEO‑Ready** — Unique metadata and Open Graph tags per page, plus autogenerated `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.
- **Compliance Notices** — Dedicated pages for privacy, terms and export/compliance notices.

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies** (requires Node.js 18+ and `pnpm`):

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Open <http://localhost:3000> with your browser to see the result. Edits to files in `app/`, `components/` and `content/` will hot‑reload the page.

3. **Build for production**:

   ```bash
   pnpm build
   pnpm start
   ```

## Customization

### Updating Company Information

Most company‑specific data (names, mission, identifiers, contract vehicles, locations and partnerships) live in `content/company.ts`. Replace the `[[PLACEHOLDER]]` tokens with real values. The company name also appears in `components/Header.tsx`, `layout.tsx` and the legal pages — search for `[[COMPANY_NAME]]` to update it.

### Editing Services

The services displayed on the site are defined in `content/services.ts`. Each service exports an object containing an `id`, `name`, `slug`, `intro`, and arrays for `what`, `how` and `outcomes`, plus a relative image path. Add or remove services as needed and ensure you create a corresponding page in `app/services/<slug>/page.tsx`.

### Adding Case Studies

Case studies live in `content/caseStudies.ts`. Add more entries to the exported array or modify existing ones. The case studies page will automatically render all items.

### Configuring Forms

The contact form in `components/ContactForm.tsx` currently logs the submission to the console. To integrate it with an email service or API, replace the submit handler with your desired logic. Ensure you handle ITAR/EAR‑restricted data appropriately and never transmit classified information through unsecured channels.

### Accessibility and Performance

The site aims to achieve Lighthouse scores ≥ 95 for performance and accessibility. To further improve scores:

- Serve appropriately sized images via Next’s `<Image>` component.
- Audit pages for colour contrast and semantic correctness.
- Lazy‑load any heavy components or third‑party scripts.

## Deployment

This project is ready to deploy on Vercel. Simply connect the repository and set the build command to `pnpm build` and the output directory to `.next`. You can also deploy on Netlify or other platforms that support Next.js. The included `vercel.json` is optional and demonstrates how to set HTTP headers if needed.

### Example Vercel Configuration (`vercel.json`)

```json
{
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "X-Content-Type-Options",
          "value": "nosniff"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Open Issues / TODOs

- Replace all `[[PLACEHOLDER]]` tokens with accurate company information (CAGE, DUNS, NAICS, socio‑economic status, facility clearance, emails, phone numbers, leadership names and bios).
- Source or generate appropriate imagery for the aerospace/space service (currently uses the same background as the hero).
- Integrate shadcn/ui components formally by running `pnpm dlx shadcn-ui@latest init` and adding any desired components such as modals or accordions.
- Implement server‑side form handling with reCAPTCHA or other spam prevention for production use.
- Review the Content Security Policy (CSP) in `next.config.mjs` and adjust it according to any analytics or third‑party integrations you choose to add.
